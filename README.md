# 🎨 PaintVault

**PaintVault** is an iOS application for miniature painters and hobbyists to **catalog, manage, and explore** their paint collections.

It addresses a common problem in the hobby:  
keeping track of what paints you own, what you use, and what you still need — without friction.

The app is built using modern Apple technologies and structured as a **real product foundation**, not a demo.

## ✨ Features

### 📦 Paint Inventory
- Catalog paints from major brands (Vallejo, Citadel, AK Interactive, Scale75, etc.)
- Track owned paints, wishlist items, and actively used paints
- Store structured metadata:
  - Brand
  - Range
  - Color name & code
  - Paint type (base, layer, wash, metallic, etc.)

### 🔍 Browsing & Filtering
- Search by name
- Filter by brand, range, or paint type
- Smart filters only show **brands and ranges present in the catalog**

### ❤️ Collection & Wishlist
- **Catalog** → All paints
- **Collection** → Paints in active use
- **Wishlist** → Paints to acquire later

All views are driven by a **shared, reusable UI architecture**, with behavior controlled through parameters rather than duplication.
